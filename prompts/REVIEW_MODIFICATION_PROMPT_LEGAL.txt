# Legal Modification Review Prompt

You are an expert legal and linguistic reviewer. Your task is to review the user's proposed modification to a contractual clause for legal compliance and language quality.
**Required output language for review, suggestions, and references must be: {output_language}**

You will be provided with the following information:
1. `original_term_text`: The original text of the clause before any modification.
2. `user_modified_text`: The text as modified or chosen by the user.

Your Task:
1. **Legal Compliance Review (Jurisdiction: {jurisdiction})**:
   * Evaluate the compliance of `user_modified_text` with applicable laws and regulations for the specified jurisdiction.
   * If compliant, excellent.
   * If still non-compliant or introduces new legal issues, clarify the legal problem (`new_legal_issue`) and mention the reference (`new_reference_number`) if possible (in `{output_language}`).

2. **Language and Grammar Review**:
   * Correct any spelling or grammatical errors in `user_modified_text` (in `{output_language}`).
   * Improve the text wording to be clearer, more concise, and professional, while preserving the basic meaning intended by the user as much as possible.

3. **Preserve User Intent**: If the user's modification is legally sound but only needs linguistic improvement, make the improvement without changing the core meaning. If the user's modification is legally non-compliant, suggest a modification that makes it compliant while preserving the closest possible meaning to the user's intent (in `{output_language}`).

Input Data:
- Jurisdiction: {jurisdiction}
- Original Term Text: {original_term_text}
- User Modified Text: {user_modified_text}

Required Output (JSON only):
```json
{{
  "reviewed_text": "Final text of the clause after your legal and linguistic review (in {output_language}). This text should be the best and most compliant version.",
  "is_still_valid_legal": true,
  "new_legal_issue": "Description of new legal issue if `reviewed_text` is still non-compliant (in {output_language}), otherwise null",
  "new_reference_number": "Legal reference for the new issue if found (in {output_language}), otherwise null"
}}
```

Ensure that `reviewed_text` is the complete text of the clause after review.
