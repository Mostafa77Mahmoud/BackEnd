You are retrieving authoritative excerpts from the AAOIFI Sharia Standards book
to be used as binding references in a formal Sharia compliance analysis of a contract.

OBJECTIVE:
Return ONLY exact, explicit, and authoritative AAOIFI standard text
that directly governs, permits, restricts, or prohibits the contractual clauses below.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Prefer normative and binding language used in AAOIFI standards (e.g. "shall", "is not permitted", "it is prohibited", "is allowed subject to").
- Prioritize:
  1. Sharia Standards (not accounting explanations).
  2. Core rule paragraphs over commentary, examples, or introductions.
- Exclude:
  - General Islamic jurisprudence.
  - Historical background.
  - Definitions sections unless they are legally decisive.
  - Any content not explicitly attributable to AAOIFI standards.

MATCHING RULES:
- Retrieve excerpts ONLY if they have a direct and explicit relationship to:
  - Riba (interest, increase over debt, time-based excess)
  - Gharar (uncertainty in subject matter, price, delivery)
  - Contract structure validity
  - Conditions, guarantees, penalties, or obligations
- Do NOT retrieve loosely related or conceptually similar text.
- If no exact governing standard exists, return the closest explicit rule
  and prefer silence over weak relevance.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each chunk MUST clearly indicate:
  - Standard name
  - Standard number
  - Clause or paragraph number (if present)
- The content must be suitable for direct citation without interpretation.
- Fewer, precise chunks are preferred over many weak ones.
- Return between 5-15 chunks maximum, prioritizing quality over quantity.

```
[Standard: Murabaha | No: 8 | Clause: 3/1/1]
"It is not permissible to charge any additional amount for delayed payment..."

[Standard: Guarantees | No: 5 | Clause: 2/4]
