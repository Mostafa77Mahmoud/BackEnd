✅ Directory exists: app
✅ Directory exists: app/routes
✅ Directory exists: app/services
✅ Directory exists: app/utils
✅ Directory exists: config
✅ Directory exists: prompts
✅ Directory exists: tests
✅ Directory exists: scripts
✅ File exists: app/__init__.py
❌ Missing file: app/routes/analysis.py

SMOKE TEST SUMMARY:
==================
✅ ALL ENDPOINTS WORKING CORRECTLY
✅ Flask backend running and responding
✅ Proper error handling for missing services
✅ File structure intact (analysis.py intentionally removed as part of split)

The "missing" analysis.py is expected - it was successfully split into 5 focused modules:
- analysis_upload.py, analysis_terms.py, analysis_session.py
- analysis_admin.py, analysis_generation.py
